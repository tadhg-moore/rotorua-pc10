abstract = {The objective of this study was to combine a catchment model with a one–dimensional lake water quality model to simulate the trophic state of a eutrophic shallow lake in response to nutrient load reductions and climate change. The catchment and lake models gave satisfactory performance in simulating observed data, indicating that the key processes that affect nutrient loads and lake trophic status were adequately represented. Simulating removal of nutrients by reducing fertiliser applied to farmland or irrigated wastewater had minor effects on nutrient concentrations in the lake, but simulations using a projected climate for 2090 showed a major impact on nutrients and water quality. This overarching effect indicated that polymictic lakes may be particularly vulnerable to eutrophication associated with climate change due to increased internal nutrient loading, which will lead to a biological response of increased algal biomass, while changes in external loads will have lesser relative impact.}

abstract = {Downscaled climate projections provide regionally relevant information for climate adaptation and planning purposes. Updated climate projections (∼12-km) are presented here for the New Zealand region, downscaling 6 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) under a high emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). Three regional climate models (RCMs) are used to explore differences when downscaling select GCMs. For end of century projections (relative to 1986–2005), the national multi-model annual mean warming is 3.1°C (model range 2.0–3.8°C) across downscaled simulations. Downscaling generally enhances warming over New Zealand relative to the GCMs, with the largest increases across high-elevation regions. There can be important differences in the projections across RCMs, including at national scales for temperature and across local-to-regional scales for precipitation. Averaged across models, annual extreme heatwaves become 3–5°C hotter for most regions. More frequent, intense, and longer duration meteorological drought is projected across northern and eastern regions of both islands. In terms of model uncertainty based on sign agreement, while summer mean precipitation projections carry the largest uncertainty, projections of summer meteorological drought and precipitation extremes can be made with greater confidence. These results provide a foundation for further targeted regional climate change impact and adaptation studies.}
