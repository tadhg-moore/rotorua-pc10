**Project Background and Objectives** 

The Bay of Plenty Regional Council engaged Jacobs to develop a groundwater flow model for the Rotorua Water Management Area to enhance water management practices.
The Rotorua Water Management Area covers approximately 1,100 km².
The model aims to improve understanding of groundwater systems and surface water interactions.
It will inform groundwater allocation limits and assess various abstraction scenarios.

**Scope of Work for Groundwater Modelling**

The project involved several key tasks to develop and document the groundwater model.

- Analyze available data and create a conceptual hydrogeological model.
- Develop and calibrate a transient three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW.
- Simulate predictive scenarios and document the model development and predictions.
- Deliver the numerical model and associated files to the Bay of Plenty Regional Council.

**Limitations of the Groundwater Modelling**

- The model does not account for certain factors that could affect groundwater and surface water quality.
- Excludes the impact of groundwater extraction on water quality.
Does not consider density effects from variable groundwater salinity or temperature.
Ignores two-phase fluids in the active geothermal reservoir.
