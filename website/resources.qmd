The report focuses on nine major streams contributing to Lake Rotorua's water
quality. - Nutrient trends were assessed using the seasonal Kendall test over
three periods: 2002-2022, 2002-2010, and 2010-2019. - The analysis includes
total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved reactive phosphorus
(DRP) concentrations and loads.

*Nutrient Concentrations and Stream Flows* This section details the mean flow
rates and nutrient concentrations in the streams entering Lake Rotorua.

-   The mean flow to Lake Rotorua from 2002-2022 was 11.8 m³/s, with Hamurana
    being the largest contributor at 2.63 m³/s.
-   The highest total nitrogen concentrations were found in Waiohewa (2839
    mg/m³) and the highest total phosphorus concentrations in Waingaehe (123
    mg/m³).
-   Streams like Hamurana, Awahou, and Waingaehe showed high concentrations of
    dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), with ratios of DRP to TP between
    80-90%.

*Trends in Nutrient Concentrations Over Time* This section discusses the
observed trends in nutrient concentrations across the monitored streams.

-   From 2002 to 2022, TN concentrations increased in Hamurana, Awahou, and
    Waiteti, particularly in Awahou and Waiteti since 2010.
-   TN concentrations decreased in Puarenga and possibly Ngongotaha, but this
    trend did not continue post-2010.
-   TP concentrations increased in Hamurana, Ngongotaha, Utuhina, Puarenga,
    Waingaehe, and Waiohewa, with trends continuing since 2010 in all but
    Waingaehe.

*Nutrient Loads to Lake Rotorua*

-   The nine main streams transported an average of 410 t/y of nitrogen and 28
    t/y of phosphorus from 2002-2022.
-   The highest TN loads came from Awahou (71.1 t/y), Puarenga (67.4 t/y), and
    Hamurana (66.5 t/y).
-   TP loads were primarily contributed by Hamurana (7.5 t/y), Puarenga (5.1
    t/y), and Awahou (3.9 t/y).

<summary>Click to expand: Summary</summary>

**Project Background and Objectives**

The Bay of Plenty Regional Council engaged Jacobs to develop a groundwater flow
model for the Rotorua Water Management Area to enhance water management
practices. The Rotorua Water Management Area covers approximately 1,100 km². The
model aims to improve understanding of groundwater systems and surface water
interactions. It will inform groundwater allocation limits and assess various
abstraction scenarios.

**Scope of Work for Groundwater Modelling**

The project involved several key tasks to develop and document the groundwater
model.

-   Analyze available data and create a conceptual hydrogeological model.
-   Develop and calibrate a transient three-dimensional numerical groundwater
    flow model using MODFLOW.
-   Simulate predictive scenarios and document the model development and
    predictions.
-   Deliver the numerical model and associated files to the Bay of Plenty
    Regional Council.

**Limitations of the Groundwater Modelling**

-   The model does not account for certain factors that could affect groundwater
    and surface water quality.
-   Excludes the impact of groundwater extraction on water quality. Does not
    consider density effects from variable groundwater salinity or temperature.
    Ignores two-phase fluids in the active geothermal reservoir.

Estimated catchment loads of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Rotorua Te Arawa
Lakes.\
ERI report 143, University of Waikato.\

<details>

<summary>Click to expand: Summary</summary>

*Importance and Context*

-    Rotorua Te Arawa Lakes are culturally, historically, and ecologically
    significant.

-    Water quality varies with catchment characteristics: undeveloped (e.g.,
    Tikitapu, Okataina) vs. highly developed agricultural/forestry (e.g.,
    Rotorua, Rerewhakaaitu, Okaro).

-    Lake water quality is strongly influenced by nutrient inputs from surface
    and groundwater flows.

*Methodology for Nutrient Loads*

-   Used updated export coefficient approach and Overseer® modelling for
    nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).

-    Land use areas calculated for surface and groundwater catchments.

-   Nutrient loss rates estimated per land use, accounting for local factors
    (e.g., pest impacts, forest removal).

-   Additional sources included geothermal inputs, septic systems, municipal
    wastewater, atmospheric deposition, and hydrological connections among
    lakes.

-   Attenuation estimated from physiography to produce a consistent regional
    nutrient budget.

*Key Findings and Implications*

-    Agricultural land contributes disproportionately to N and P loads.

-    Geothermal, atmospheric, and connected-lake sources are significant in some
    catchments.

-    Many catchments exceed ‘reference’ nutrient loads by 2–3×, complicating
    restoration.

-   Provides basis for assessing internal lake loading and guiding
    catchment/lake management strategies.

**Example Nutrient Loads (kg/yr)**

-   Lake Rotorua: N 721,427, P 56,760.5

Modeling the effects of climate change on water quality of Lake Rotorua, New
Zealand.

<details>

<summary>Click to expand: Summary</summary>

*Modelling Hydrology and Water Quality* This study integrates a catchment model
with a lake water quality model to assess the impacts of nutrient load
reductions and climate change on a eutrophic lake.

-   The study combines SWAT and DYRESM–CAEDYM models to simulate nutrient
    dynamics and water quality.
-   The models performed satisfactorily in simulating observed data, indicating
    accurate representation of key processes.
-   Nutrient load reductions from agricultural practices had minor effects on
    lake nutrient concentrations.
-   Climate change projections for 2090 showed significant impacts on nutrient
    levels and water quality.

*Nutrient Load Reductions and Their Effects* The study evaluates how reducing
nutrient loads affects the trophic state of Lake Rotorua.

-   Simulations indicated that reducing fertilizer and wastewater irrigation had
    limited impact on lake nutrient concentrations.
-   The projected climate change for 2090 is expected to increase internal
    nutrient loading significantly.
-   Polymictic lakes like Lake Rotorua are particularly vulnerable to
    eutrophication due to climate change.

*Climate Change Impacts on Water Quality* This section discusses the influence
of climate change on hydrological cycles and nutrient dynamics.

-   Increased precipitation is predicted to raise total phosphorus loads by
    3.3%–16.5% in Danish streams.
-   A study in Slovenia projected total nitrogen losses could increase by 5.3%
    to 80.2% due to climate change.
-   Climate change is expected to directly affect lake water temperature and
    stratification, altering nutrient dynamics.

Lake Rotorua Treated Wastewater Discharge: Environmental Effects Study ERI
Report 80, University of Waikato. [PDF](https://hdl.handle.net/10289/12474)

<details>

<summary>Click to expand: Summary</summary>

*Key Findings*

-   The treated wastewater discharge contributes a measurable nutrient load to
    Lake Rotorua, which may influence the lake’s trophic status, algal growth,
    and water-quality trends.
-   There is evidence of spatial variability in how the discharge impacts the
    lake — e.g., nearer to the discharge site showing different water quality
    versus more remote parts of the lake.
-   The effectiveness of the current wastewater treatment and discharge regime
    is assessed and found to have limitations: even treated wastewater can
    contribute significant nutrient inputs if volumes are large and/or treatment
    is not optimised.
-   The report discusses the lake’s capacity to assimilate or dilute the
    nutrient load, and whether it is being exceeded or approaching thresholds
    that may degrade ecological health.

*Implications & Recommendations*

-   Management of wastewater inputs to Lake Rotorua must account not just for
    concentration of nutrients in the effluent but for volume of discharge and
    how that interacts with lake hydrodynamics (mixing, stratification,
    residence time).
-   Upgrading treatment processes, reducing nutrient concentrations further, or
    reducing the volume of discharge may be necessary to protect lake health.
-   Monitoring of water quality and ecological responses (algal blooms, oxygen
    levels, benthic habitat) should continue and be linked explicitly to
    discharge data to evaluate trends.
-   Lake management strategies should take a holistic view: catchment land-use,
    inflows, internal nutrient cycling, and wastewater discharges all interact
    to determine lake condition.

Predicting the effects of nutrient loads, management regimes and climate change
on water quality of Lake Rotorua. (pers. comm. 2025-11-24)

<details>

<summary>Click to expand: Summary</summary>

*Lake Rotorua's Water Quality Challenges* Lake Rotorua has faced significant
water quality decline due to nutrient loads and land use changes, necessitating
a comprehensive management strategy.

-   Lake area: 80 km², mean depth: 10 m.
-   Cultural significance to the Te Arawa people and vital for tourism and
    recreation.
-   Water quality deterioration began in the 1960s, linked to treated wastewater
    inputs and land use changes from forest to pasture.
-   Urban wastewater discharge ceased in 1991, but ongoing pastoral expansion,
    especially dairy farming, has continued to impact water quality.
-   Legacy effects from historical land use and nutrient pools in sediments
    complicate current management efforts.

*Modelling Approach for Water Quality Management* A modelling approach is
essential for assessing the impacts of land use, climate change, and management
actions on Lake Rotorua's water quality.

-   Integrated multiple models: SimCLIM, ROTAN, CLUES, DYRESM-CAEDYM.
-   SimCLIM predicts climate data (temperature, rainfall) for the Rotorua
    catchment up to 2100.
-   ROTAN simulates streamflows and nitrate transport between surface water and
    groundwater.
-   CLUES estimates annual average phosphorus loads in streams.
-   DYRESM-CAEDYM models vertical distribution of water temperature and nutrient
    cycling relevant to trophic state.

*Nutrient Load Reduction Requirements* To improve water quality, significant
reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus loads are necessary.

-   At least 350 tonnes of nitrogen and a similar amount of phosphorus must be
    removed annually.
-   Target Trophic Level Index (TLI) value set at 4.2 to restore water quality.
-   Climate change is expected to exacerbate challenges, increasing
    stratification and internal nutrient loading.
-   Internal nutrient release from sediments is comparable to external loads,
    complicating management.

*Internal Nutrient Loading and Management Strategies* Addressing internal
nutrient loading is critical for achieving long-term water quality goals in Lake
Rotorua.

-   Internal loading from sediments contributes significantly to nutrient
    levels, especially during stratification.
-   Chemical flocculants may reduce internal loading but have limited duration
    of effectiveness (approximately four years).
-   Effective sediment capping can offset water quality deterioration but
    requires prior reduction of catchment nutrient loads.
