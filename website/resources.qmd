The report focuses on nine major streams contributing to Lake Rotorua's water quality.
- Nutrient trends were assessed using the seasonal Kendall test over three periods: 2002-2022, 2002-2010, and 2010-2019.
- The analysis includes total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations and loads.

*Nutrient Concentrations and Stream Flows*
This section details the mean flow rates and nutrient concentrations in the streams entering Lake Rotorua.

- The mean flow to Lake Rotorua from 2002-2022 was 11.8 m³/s, with Hamurana being the largest contributor at 2.63 m³/s.
- The highest total nitrogen concentrations were found in Waiohewa (2839 mg/m³) and the highest total phosphorus concentrations in Waingaehe (123 mg/m³).
- Streams like Hamurana, Awahou, and Waingaehe showed high concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), with ratios of DRP to TP between 80-90%.

*Trends in Nutrient Concentrations Over Time*
This section discusses the observed trends in nutrient concentrations across the monitored streams.

- From 2002 to 2022, TN concentrations increased in Hamurana, Awahou, and Waiteti, particularly in Awahou and Waiteti since 2010.
- TN concentrations decreased in Puarenga and possibly Ngongotaha, but this trend did not continue post-2010.
- TP concentrations increased in Hamurana, Ngongotaha, Utuhina, Puarenga, Waingaehe, and Waiohewa, with trends continuing since 2010 in all but Waingaehe.

*Nutrient Loads to Lake Rotorua*

- The nine main streams transported an average of 410 t/y of nitrogen and 28 t/y of phosphorus from 2002-2022.
- The highest TN loads came from Awahou (71.1 t/y), Puarenga (67.4 t/y), and Hamurana (66.5 t/y).
- TP loads were primarily contributed by Hamurana (7.5 t/y), Puarenga (5.1 t/y), and Awahou (3.9 t/y).

**Project Background and Objectives** 

The Bay of Plenty Regional Council engaged Jacobs to develop a groundwater flow model for the Rotorua Water Management Area to enhance water management practices.
The Rotorua Water Management Area covers approximately 1,100 km².
The model aims to improve understanding of groundwater systems and surface water interactions.
It will inform groundwater allocation limits and assess various abstraction scenarios.

**Scope of Work for Groundwater Modelling**

The project involved several key tasks to develop and document the groundwater model.

- Analyze available data and create a conceptual hydrogeological model.
- Develop and calibrate a transient three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW.
- Simulate predictive scenarios and document the model development and predictions.
- Deliver the numerical model and associated files to the Bay of Plenty Regional Council.

**Limitations of the Groundwater Modelling**

- The model does not account for certain factors that could affect groundwater and surface water quality.
- Excludes the impact of groundwater extraction on water quality.
Does not consider density effects from variable groundwater salinity or temperature.
Ignores two-phase fluids in the active geothermal reservoir.
