This project uses the `targets` package for pipeline management in R. The `targets` package helps to automate the workflow by defining a series of steps (targets) that depend on each other. Each target represents a piece of data or a computation, and `targets` ensures that only the necessary parts of the pipeline are re-executed when changes occur.

Here is a visual network showing the relationships between the targets in this project:

```{r}
#| label: visnetwork
#| echo: false
#| 
targets::tar_visnetwork()
```
