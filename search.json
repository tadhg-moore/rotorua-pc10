This corresponds to relative humidity (hurs) for the historical scenario from the ACCESS-CM2 GCM, downscaled using the CCAM model over New Zealand at a daily timestep and 5 km spatial resolution, without bias correction.\nLoading and reading data from these NetCDF files can be done using the ncdf4 package in R.

The Rotorua Water Management Area covers approximately 1,100 km². The model aims to improve understanding of groundwater systems and surface water interactions. It will inform groundwater allocation limits and assess various abstraction scenarios.\nScope of Work for Groundwater Modelling\nThe project involved several key tasks to develop and document the groundwater model.\n\nAnalyze available data and create a conceptual hydrogeological model.\nDevelop and calibrate a transient three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW.\nSimulate predictive scenarios and document the model development and predictions.\nDeliver the numerical model and associated files to the Bay of Plenty Regional Council.\n\nLimitations of the Groundwater Modelling\n\nThe model does not account for certain factors that could affect groundwater and surface water quality.\nExcludes the impact of groundwater extraction on water quality. Does not consider density effects from variable groundwater salinity or temperature. Ignores two-phase fluids in the active geothermal reservoir."

PDF\n\n\nClick to expand: Summary\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe treated wastewater discharge contributes a measurable nutrient load to Lake Rotorua, which may influence the lake’s trophic status, algal growth, and water-quality trends.\nThere is evidence of spatial variability in how the discharge impacts the lake — e.g., nearer to the discharge site showing different water quality versus more remote parts of the lake.\nThe effectiveness of the current wastewater treatment and discharge regime is assessed and found to have limitations: even treated wastewater can contribute significant nutrient inputs if volumes are large and/or treatment is not optimised.\nThe report discusses the lake’s capacity to assimilate or dilute the nutrient load, and whether it is being exceeded or approaching thresholds that may degrade ecological health.\n\nImplications & Recommendations\n\nManagement of wastewater inputs to Lake Rotorua must account not just for concentration of nutrients in the effluent but for volume of discharge and how that interacts with lake hydrodynamics (mixing, stratification, residence time).\nUpgrading treatment processes, reducing nutrient concentrations further, or reducing the volume of discharge may be necessary to protect lake health.\nMonitoring of water quality and ecological responses (algal blooms, oxygen levels, benthic habitat) should continue and be linked explicitly to discharge data to evaluate trends.\nLake management strategies should take a holistic view: catchment land-use, inflows, internal nutrient cycling, and wastewater discharges all interact to determine lake condition."

(pers. comm. 2025-11-24)\n\n\nClick to expand: Summary\n\nLake Rotorua’s Water Quality Challenges Lake Rotorua has faced significant water quality decline due to nutrient loads and land use changes, necessitating a comprehensive management strategy.\n\nLake area: 80 km², mean depth: 10 m.\nCultural significance to the Te Arawa people and vital for tourism and recreation.\nWater quality deterioration began in the 1960s, linked to treated wastewater inputs and land use changes from forest to pasture.\nUrban wastewater discharge ceased in 1991, but ongoing pastoral expansion, especially dairy farming, has continued to impact water quality.\nLegacy effects from historical land use and nutrient pools in sediments complicate current management efforts.\n\nModelling Approach for Water Quality Management A modelling approach is essential for assessing the impacts of land use, climate change, and management actions on Lake Rotorua’s water quality.\n\nIntegrated multiple models: SimCLIM, ROTAN, CLUES, DYRESM-CAEDYM.\nSimCLIM predicts climate data (temperature, rainfall) for the Rotorua catchment up to 2100.\nROTAN simulates streamflows and nitrate transport between surface water and groundwater.\nCLUES estimates annual average phosphorus loads in streams.\nDYRESM-CAEDYM models vertical distribution of water temperature and nutrient cycling relevant to trophic state.\n\nNutrient Load Reduction Requirements To improve water quality, significant reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus loads are necessary.\n\nAt least 350 tonnes of nitrogen and a similar amount of phosphorus must be removed annually.\nTarget Trophic Level Index (TLI) value set at 4.2 to restore water quality.\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate challenges, increasing stratification and internal nutrient loading.\nInternal nutrient release from sediments is comparable to external loads, complicating management.\n\nInternal Nutrient Loading and Management Strategies Addressing internal nutrient loading is critical for achieving long-term water quality goals in Lake Rotorua.\n\nInternal loading from sediments contributes significantly to nutrient levels, especially during stratification.\nChemical flocculants may reduce internal loading but have limited duration of effectiveness (approximately four years).\nEffective sediment capping can offset water quality deterioration but requires prior reduction of catchment nutrient loads."
